# the office gifs

This small project displays random gifs from 'The Office' using GIPHY's API. It also shows the gif's URL for embedding.

**note**: as it's pulling from GIPHY, it's relying on tags that users have created themselves. therefore, it isn't perfect and some non-office related gifs will show up
